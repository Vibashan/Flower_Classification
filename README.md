Download DATASET: https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition                                                        
After downloading the dataset, run Dataset_create.py to create .npy file                                                       
We feed this created .npy file into the CNN and train the model.The trained model is used for the classification of flower.
